# Obin

This is my project for the Summer School in "Integrating Personalized Mobility Solutions for Digital Cities", lead by TallTech, the Tallin University of Technology, Estonia, in two weeks.

We develop a real-working prototype (the code is publicy available in the report) with a raspberry and an ultrasound sensor in order detect the level of garbage inside a garbage bin and so to create an IoT network of bins with an user interface to improve the waste management system of the city.
All of this correlated with a validation phase that we did in Tallin, and the business model and cash flow that we develop for our solution.
